# IP ADDRESS

An IP address, short for "Internet Protocol address," is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main purposes:

## IPV4

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and is the most widely used version for identifying and locating devices on a network. It is an essential part of how data packets are routed across the internet.
Key features of IPv4 include:

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long and expressed in a dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Each octet in the address represents 8 bits, allowing for a total of approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

Due to the rapid growth of the internet and the limited number of IPv4 addresses available,
IPv4 address exhaustion became a significant concern. The last blocks of IPv4 addresses were allocated in early 2011,
leading to the adoption of IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) as the next-generation IP addressing scheme.

## IPV6

->IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and serves as the successor to IPv4. It was developed to address the limitations of IPv4,
primarily the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses.

IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, expressed in hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). The 128-bit address space allows for a virtually infinite number of unique IP addresses,
which effectively eliminates the issue of address exhaustion faced by IPv4.
