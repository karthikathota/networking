# LOCALHOST

Localhost refers to the network address of the current device you are using. It is used to access the web applications or web services that are running on the same device.

## Address

The address of the localhsot is same for all the device i.r 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 protocol and ::1 in IPv6.
Accessing thid IP address makes you connect to your web applications hosted on your personal deivce
So, developers mostly use it to deploy servers on their local deivce and fix the bugs before deploying on live server.

## Security

Since localhost is a loopback address, it is not accessible from external networks by default. This provides a level of security,
as services or applications hosted on localhost are not exposed to the broader internet.
