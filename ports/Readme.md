# PORTS IN NETWORKING

In networking, a port is a communication endpoint that allows a computer or network device to identify specific applications or services running on another device.

When data is sent over a network, it is divided into packets. Each packet contains both the data being transmitted and information about the source and destination of the data. This information includes the source and destination IP addresses as well as the port numbers.
Port numbers help to direct data packets to the correct applications or services on the destination device.
