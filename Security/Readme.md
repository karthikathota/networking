# Hashing

Hashing is a technique used in computing to transform input data into a 
fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a sequence of numbers and letters. This fixed-size string is known as a hash value or hash code. Hashing is generally done to secure passwords and other 
sensitive information to secure the users data.
